BCNF: 
Researcher (Email, first_name, last_name, organization)

    Email -> first_name, last_name, organization

    This table is in BCNF because the primary key, the "Email" is the only attribute that determins the rest of the tuple
    - Two people with the same firt and last name can attend the same organization as we see in our daily lives

Application_Collabs (Aid, collaborator_email)

    This table is in BCNF because the primary key is the whole tuple. 
    - We can have 2 different people collaborating in the same application 
      as we can have one person researching in different applications 
      Therefore, the only way to uniquely identify a touple is to know the 
      Aid as well as the collaborator_email

Application_Reviewers (aid, Reviewer_email, status)

    This table is in BCNF because the primary key is the whole tuple. 
      - We can have 2 different people reviewing the same application 
        as we can have one person reviweing different applications 
        Therefore, the only way to uniquely identify a touple is to know the 
        Aid as well as the Reviewer_email

Applications (Aid,  Cid, principal_email, status, submission_date, requested_amount, awarded_Amount) 

    Aid -> Cid, principal_email, status, submission_date, requested_amount, awarded_amount

    None of the attributes on the RHS can uniquely identify a touple, therefore this table is in BCNF
    
    Cid               - there can be multiple applications per Competition 
    principal_email   - a researcher can be the principal researcher of multiple applications simultaneously
    status            - many applications can be submitted not awarded_Amount, or awarded 
    submission_date   - many application can be submitted the on the same date
    requested_amount  - many applications can request the same amount
    awarded_amount    - many applications can be rewarded the same amount
    
    Any proper subset of these attributes will not be able to uniquely identify a touple on a big or "normal sized" database

Competitions (Cid, topic, title, description, status, Mid)

    Cid -> topic, title, description, status, Mid

    topic, title, description - can be reused for many compatitions
    status            - many competitions can have the same status 
    Mid               - many competitions are discussed in each meeting

    Any proper subset of these attributes will not be able to uniquely identify a touple on a big or "normal sized" database

Meeting (Mid, date)

    This table is in BCNF because the primary key is the whole tuple.
